                <p>This course is a required workshop series designed to prepare students for the Summer Capstone Project. The first workshop focuses on strategies and tactics for solving problems independently using AI. Subsequent workshops cover key topics such as identifying and framing business problems to deliver measurable value, collecting data from APIs and websites, and considering the ethical implications of working with data.</p>
